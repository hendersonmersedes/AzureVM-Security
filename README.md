<p>Azure VM Security</p>
<p>I am still learning all the ins and outs of security so I started playing around in Azure again and discovered a great amount of resources that can be used to defend resources. I also wanted to learn more about how I can break into those resources so I created a few VMs to get me started.</p>
<ol>
   <li> Logging into the Azure portal (portal.azure.com)</li>
   <li> Create a new resource group</li>
   <li> Go to Virtual Machines and Create a Windows 2016 VM</li>
 </ol>
